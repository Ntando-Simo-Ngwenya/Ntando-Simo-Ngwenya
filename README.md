- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ntando-Simo-Ngwenya
- 👀 I’m interested in intergrating data analytics into the data capturing and visualization stages of geological exploration. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to manipulate data from my PhD (Geology) research project using data analytics tools like SQL, Python & Git. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything along the lines of what I am interested in, and am very open to acquiring new skills through any available opportunities.
